# To do list
I'll slowly remove things from this list if I ever get around to them.
### Pirates
Get around to being able to spawn pirates that the player will be 
attacked by, to actually make use of the player's chance of attack 
setup.

### Clean code up
Reorganize trader.cpp to be much more readable.
More verbose commenting.
Also make better use of player.sav

### Initial startup things
Add things like prompts for player and ship names the first time the 
game is started.
